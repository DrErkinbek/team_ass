## Module 4 Team Project

Your team is to write a program to print a 
number of options presented to the user and 
allow the user to select an option from the
list.

The options should be numbered from 1 – 9; 
although your team can use less than 9 options, but make sure there are at least 6
options. If the user selects a valid choice,
the program should print a short message. 
The message should include the value that 
the user typed

## Module 6 Team Assignment

Your team is to write a guessing program that 
will take a number (input) from the user 
and guess a randomly generated number. 
Provide the user with an opportunity to 
guess higher or lower, depending on the 
randomly generated number. Remember to 
use python module(s) and nested if…else 
statements in your code.
